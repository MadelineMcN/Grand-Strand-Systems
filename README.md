## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

There are several steps that I can take to ensure my code is functional and secure. The first thing I check is to make sure there are no errors present in the codebase when I build the project. I then run the project to make sure the application can run without crashing. During this stage, I will manually the application. After the manual check, I write out my unit tests. These unit tests will check my code logic and verify that the correct output is produced when tested against specific inputs. 


## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

From my experience, user needs should be documented as requirements for a project. Once they have been refined in a way that details how everything should look and function, development can begin.  How they are incorporated is dependent on what the requirement is. However, if there is any ambiguity or unclear requirements, they should be addressed in the static testing phase with the product team.



## How do I approach designing software?

I approach software design with testing in mind. When I write code, I like to think about how I can make each method or class more testable. I also think about architecture. If I am able to modularize different functionality of the application, I know that this is a more scalable approach.  Similarly, separating out functionality helps with code readability and organization.
